Dhoni should play 2019 World Cup because he takes load off Kohli, says Gavaskar.
It was Virat Kohli first who cleared the air with his "MS Dhoni is integral part of the side" message after the fifth and final ODI against West Indies and now Gavaskar too has joined the 'Dhoni for 2019 World Cup' chorus.When asked if he should be a part of the 50-overs squad for the 2019 World Cup in England, Gavaskar said: "There is no question.But, Gavaskar advocates Dhoni's presence for the counsel he provides to Kohli.On the selectors laying a new path for Indian cricket in T20 action by leaving Dhoni out for Rishabh Pant, Gavaskar believes Dhoni would have been part of decision making."It is noble of MS Dhoni to make way for Rishab Pant because he clearly realises that he is not going to be there for the T20 World Cup in 2020.But Gavaskar did feel Dhoni not playing T20s would rob him of some match time and advises him to reconsider his call not to play Ranji cricket."Because the World Cup is so close, I would like him to play a few more matches because once you go past the age of 35 your reflexes slow down.Therefore if you are constantly playing competitive cricket, your reflexes stay in tact.Even if that may not be of the same grade but first class cricket can keep you competitive.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app.Dhoni's experience will be missed but great opportunity for Pant and Karthik: Rohit.
